# Multi-Account Authentication Plan

RepoBar's current authentication code is intentionally small and clean, but it is wired around a single signed-in account. This document maps the current single-account surface and proposes a staged path to multi-account support.

## Implementation Status

The 0.6.6 cycle landed the bulk of the plan end-to-end behind a backward-compatible facade. The legacy single-account `TokenStore` keys (`default`, `client`, `pat`) and the `githubHost` / `enterpriseHost` / `loopbackPort` / `authMethod` `UserSettings` fields are still authoritative for installs that have not been re-auth'd; the new account-scoped keys, settings, caches, and clients are populated on first login (or via the legacy migration on bootstrap) without removing those legacy entries.

Landed:

- Phase 0/1 — `Account`, `AccountSelection`, and `AccountScopedRepositoryLists` live in `RepoBarCore`; `UserSettings` decodes/encodes the new fields with safe defaults and omits them when empty so legacy reads stay clean.
- Phase 1 — `TokenStore` exposes `save/load/clear(tokens:|clientCredentials:|PAT:_:accountID:)` plus an account index that lets callers enumerate accounts on the Keychain or file backend.
- Phase 2 — `AccountManager` (`Sources/RepoBar/Auth/AccountManager.swift`) owns one provider client per `Account` and an account-scoped OAuth refresher for GitHub OAuth accounts; `AppState` bootstraps it and `tokenRefreshTask` now drives `refreshAllIfNeeded()`.
- Phase 2 — `AppState+Accounts.swift` performs a one-shot migration that probes `GET /user` with whichever credential currently exists, records the resulting `Account`, and copies tokens under the account-scoped keys.
- Phase 3 — `Session` exposes `accountSessions` / `activeAccountID` / `aggregatedRepositories`, and `TaggedRepo` provides a collision-safe wrapper for the menu fan-out path. Single-account `repositories` and `accessibleRepositories` continue to drive existing UI.
- Phase 4 — `HTTPResponseDiskCache` and `RepoBarPersistentCache` accept an `accountID:` parameter and resolve to `~/Library/Application Support/RepoBar/Cache/<account>.sqlite` (legacy path used when `accountID` is `nil`). `GraphQLResponseDiskCache.scoped(accountID:)` follows the same pattern.
- Phase 5 — `AccountSettingsView` shows an account list (use / visibility / verify / remove) above the legacy single-account form, which is now labelled "Add Account".
- Phase 6 — CLI gains `repobar accounts list/use/remove`, plus `--account`/`--all` on `logout`, `--account` on `status`, and `--label` on `login`/`import-gh-token`. After successful auth both commands fetch `GET /user`, derive a stable `Account`, and persist tokens under the account-scoped keys in addition to the legacy fast-path entries.

Deferred:

- Notification / reference monitor fan-out across accounts. The model currently lives on the active account only; `Session.aggregatedRepositories` is populated but not yet consumed by the menu builders or background pollers.
- Per-account rate-limit display in the menu and Settings (Account list shows a single status today).
- Removing the legacy fixed `TokenStore` keys after migration. The migration helper writes the account-scoped copies; the legacy entries remain in place for now so a downgrade keeps working.

## Current Auth Model

The auth surface is hardwired around one account in these places:

- `TokenStore` (`Sources/RepoBarCore/Auth/TokenStore.swift`) is the only persistence layer. It keys items by `kSecAttrService = "com.steipete.repobar.auth"` and three fixed accounts: `"default"` for OAuth tokens, `"client"` for OAuth client credentials, and `"pat"` for Personal Access Tokens. `TokenStore.shared` is used as a singleton everywhere. The file-backed fallback mirrors the same shape under `~/Library/Application Support/RepoBar/DebugAuth/`.
- `OAuthLoginFlow` (`Sources/RepoBarCore/Auth/OAuthLoginFlow.swift`) runs the PKCE and loopback exchange, using port `53682` by default, and writes tokens into the fixed keys.
- `OAuthTokenRefresher` (`Sources/RepoBarCore/Auth/OAuthTokenRefresher.swift`) loads and saves the same single OAuth token record.
- `OAuthCoordinator` (`Sources/RepoBar/Auth/OAuthCoordinator.swift`) and `PATAuthenticator` (`Sources/RepoBar/Auth/PATAuthenticator.swift`) cache one token set in memory and one `lastHost`.
- `GitHubClient` (`Sources/RepoBarCore/API/GitHubClient.swift`) is an actor with one `apiHost`, one `tokenProvider`, and an embedded `GraphQLClient` actor with one endpoint.
- `Session` (`Sources/RepoBar/App/Session.swift`) holds one `AccountState` and one `accessibleRepositories` / `repositories` list.
- `UserSettings` (`Sources/RepoBarCore/Settings/UserSettings.swift`) carries single `githubHost`, `enterpriseHost`, `authMethod`, and `loopbackPort` fields.
- `AppState` (`Sources/RepoBar/App/AppState.swift`) owns one `OAuthCoordinator`, one `PATAuthenticator`, one `GitHubClient`, and a token-refresh task that assumes "the" account.
- The persistent cache (`Sources/RepoBarCore/Support/RepoBarCacheDatabase.swift`) is exposed through `RepoBarPersistentCache.standardDatabaseURL` and backed internally by `HTTPResponseDiskCache.standardDatabaseURL`; both currently resolve to one `~/Library/Application Support/RepoBar/Cache.sqlite` path that is not partitioned by account.
- The CLI auth commands (`Sources/repobarcli/Commands.swift`) for `login`, `logout`, `status`, and `import-gh-token` reach for `TokenStore.shared` directly.

The existing spec already notes that the architecture should be ready for multi-account while the UI surfaces one account. The useful part is that `OAuthLoginFlow`, `OAuthTokenRefresher`, and `PATAuthenticator` are already injectable with a `TokenStore` parameter, and `GitHubClient` is per-instance state, so spinning up clients per account is straightforward.

The main work is replacing singleton assumptions, scoping persisted data, and making repository identity collision-safe.

## Target Shape

Add a typed `Account` record, an account-aware persistence layer, an `AccountManager` that owns per-account `GitHubClient` actors, and a `Session` that aggregates per-account state. The UI grows an account list, while the data layer unions repositories across accounts and tags every repository with its source account.

## Phase 0: Data Model

Add an `Account` model to `RepoBarCore`:

```swift
public struct Account: Identifiable, Codable, Equatable, Sendable {
    public let id: String
    public var displayName: String
    public var username: String
    public var host: URL
    public var apiHost: URL
    public var authMethod: AuthMethod
    public var loopbackPort: Int
    public var clientID: String?
    public var addedAt: Date
}
```

Suggested account ID formula:

```swift
"\(host.host!.lowercased())#\(username.lowercased())"
```

That keeps re-login stable for the same user and host while allowing `displayName` to change without breaking references.

Extend `UserSettings` with:

- `accounts: [Account] = []`
- `activeAccountID: String?`
- `accountSelection: AccountSelection = .all`, where selection is `.all` or `.only(Set<String>)`

Keep the existing `githubHost`, `enterpriseHost`, `authMethod`, and `loopbackPort` fields as compatibility shims for one release. Treat them as derived from `activeAccountID`, then remove them later.

## Phase 1: Account-Scoped TokenStore

Keep existing call sites working by adding account-scoped methods and preserving old methods as wrappers around `accountID = "default"`:

```swift
public extension TokenStore {
    func save(tokens: OAuthTokens, accountID: String) throws
    func loadTokens(accountID: String) throws -> OAuthTokens?
    func save(clientCredentials: OAuthClientCredentials, accountID: String) throws
    func loadClientCredentials(accountID: String) throws -> OAuthClientCredentials?
    func savePAT(_ token: String, accountID: String) throws
    func loadPAT(accountID: String) throws -> String?
    func clear(accountID: String)
    func allAccountIDs() throws -> [String]
}
```

Implementation detail:

- Keychain: change `kSecAttrAccount` from `"default"`, `"client"`, and `"pat"` to `"\(accountID):default"`, `"\(accountID):client"`, and `"\(accountID):pat"`.
- File backend: use the same account-key strings in filenames. The existing file backend already maps account-like names to files, so this remains a small change.

Migration:

1. On first launch with the new build, if `UserSettings.accounts` is empty and either a legacy `default` OAuth token or a legacy `pat` token exists, call `GET /user` once with whichever credential is available. Prefer OAuth tokens when both exist so refresh metadata is preserved, but do not skip PAT-only users.
2. Build an `Account` from the returned login and configured host.
3. Copy OAuth tokens, client credentials, and/or PAT values under the new account ID.
4. Delete the legacy fixed keys.
5. Persist the new account list and `activeAccountID`.

Update `docs/auth-storage.md` to document the new schema.

## Phase 2: AccountManager Owns Auth And Clients

Promote the single-account coordination into a manager at `Sources/RepoBar/Auth/AccountManager.swift`:

```swift
@MainActor
final class AccountManager {
    private(set) var accounts: [Account] = []
    private var clients: [String: GitHubClient] = [:]
    private var refreshers: [String: OAuthTokenRefresher] = [:]
    private let tokenStore = TokenStore.shared

    func bootstrap(from settings: UserSettings) async
    func addOAuthAccount(host: URL, clientID: String, clientSecret: String, port: Int) async throws -> Account
    func addPATAccount(host: URL, pat: String) async throws -> Account
    func remove(accountID: String) async
    func client(for accountID: String) -> GitHubClient?
    func refreshIfNeeded(accountID: String, force: Bool = false) async throws -> OAuthTokens?
    func refreshAllIfNeeded() async
}
```

Each `GitHubClient` gets its own `apiHost` and a `tokenProvider` closure that reads account-scoped tokens. `GraphQLClient.setEndpoint` already supports GitHub Enterprise, so the client should not need major changes.

`OAuthCoordinator` and `PATAuthenticator` can remain as internal helpers used by `AccountManager`, or they can be folded in later. The lowest-risk path is to instantiate them per account and wire their token access through the new `TokenStore` methods.

## Phase 3: Multi-Account Session And Refresh

Change `Session` to represent multiple account sessions and a tagged aggregate repository list:

```swift
@Observable
final class Session {
    var accounts: [AccountSession] = []
    var activeAccountID: String?
    var aggregatedRepositories: [TaggedRepo] = []
}

struct AccountSession: Identifiable {
    let id: String
    var account: Account
    var state: AccountState
    var repositories: [Repository]
    var accessibleRepositories: [Repository]
    var rateLimitReset: Date?
    var lastError: String?
}

struct TaggedRepo: Identifiable {
    var repo: Repository
    let accountID: String
    var id: String { "\(accountID)|\(repo.id)" }
}
```

`AppState+Refresh` becomes a fan-out:

1. Iterate `session.accounts`.
2. Fetch each account with its account-specific client, preferably in parallel.
3. Merge into `aggregatedRepositories`.
4. Honor `settings.accountSelection` so users can hide accounts from the menu without removing them.

Pinned and hidden repository settings should move from a single `owner/name` list to an account-scoped form such as `accountID:owner/name`. For migration, treat legacy entries as belonging to the migrated account.

Rate-limit display remains per-account. For the menu-bar meter, choose one clear rule, such as worst-of visible accounts, while the diagnostics view exposes all account buckets.

## Phase 4: Cache Partitioning

Make persistent caches account-scoped:

- `RepoBarPersistentCache.standardDatabaseURL` and the internal `HTTPResponseDiskCache.standardDatabaseURL` path derivation become account-scoped, resolving to `~/Library/Application Support/RepoBar/Cache/<accountID>.sqlite`.
- Keep a separate shared database only for data that is not account-bound, such as local git state.
- On migration, rename the existing `Cache.sqlite` into the migrated account's cache location.
- Partition `GraphQLResponseDiskCache` similarly, passing an account-scoped directory through `GitHubClient` initialization.

This prevents stale or private data from one account from being served under another account and avoids repository ID collisions across GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise.

## Phase 5: UI

Rewrite `AccountSettingsView` (`Sources/RepoBar/Settings/AccountSettingsView.swift`) into two regions.

Accounts list:

- Row with avatar, `username @ host`, auth method badge, and status.
- Per-row actions: `Check token`, `Refresh token`, and `Remove`.
- Drag-to-reorder support.
- Default account selection.

Add account section:

- Reuse the existing host picker for GitHub.com vs Enterprise.
- Reuse the existing authentication picker for OAuth vs PAT.
- Additions always create another account instead of replacing the current account.

Menu changes:

- In `StatusBarMenuBuilder`, group repositories by account when more than one account is signed in.
- Add account headers that show username, host, and a rate-limit indicator.
- Add an `Accounts` submenu with quick toggles for which accounts appear in the menu.

## Phase 6: CLI

Extend `Sources/repobarcli/Commands.swift` with account-aware commands:

```text
repobar accounts list [--json|--plain]
repobar accounts use <accountID|username@host>
repobar accounts remove <accountID|username@host>
repobar login --host ... [--label "Work"]
repobar logout [--account <id>] [--all]
repobar status [--account <id>] [--all]
repobar repos [--account <id>] [--all]
```

Parse `--account` once in a shared option group so every command can honor it. Default behavior when `--account` is omitted:

1. Use `activeAccountID`, if present.
2. Fall back to the only configured account, if exactly one exists.
3. Otherwise show a friendly error asking the user to choose an account.

`import-gh-token` should learn `--account` and `--label` so multiple `gh` hostnames can map to distinct RepoBar accounts.

## Phase 7: Tests

Add suites around the new account boundary:

- `TokenStoreAccountScopingTests`: saving under account A does not load under account B, and legacy `default` keys are not visible after migration.
- `AccountMigrationTests`: legacy keychain or file-backed tokens plus empty `accounts` settles into one account with a derived ID.
- `AccountManagerTests`: add/remove behavior, refresh isolation, and two accounts on the same host storing distinct credentials.
- `MultiAccountRepoMergeTests`: pinned/hidden filtering by `accountID:owner/name`, plus repository dedupe behavior.
- `CLIAccountFlagTests`: `--account` resolution and the no-accounts friendly error path.

Existing tests under `Tests/RepoBarTests/` and `Tests/repobarcliTests/` should not require behavior changes if Phase 1 preserves the single-account wrappers.

## Edge Cases To Decide Up Front

### Two accounts on the same host

The proposed account ID formula handles `github.com#personal` and `github.com#work`, but OAuth uses one client ID/secret and one loopback port. Decide whether each account can override `clientID`, `clientSecret`, and `loopbackPort`.

Loopback port collisions across simultaneous logins should be serialized. The cheapest safe rule is one in-flight login at a time.

### Repository collisions

The same repository can appear under multiple accounts. `TaggedRepo.id` keeps Swift collection identity collision-safe. The menu may still dedupe visually by `fullName` when both accounts have access, preferring write access and then the account with the healthier API state.

### PR notifications and reference monitor

`GitHubPullRequestNotificationRunner` and `GitHubReferenceMonitor` need to know which account produced a notification or match so deep links and cached metadata remain correct. Add `accountID` to the relevant snapshot and store types.

### Monitored owners and actions billing

Today `monitoredOwners` is one flat list. Move it to `[accountID: [String]]` or resolve the same flat owner list against each account's accessible organizations. The flat-list option is simpler, but it needs clear diagnostics when an owner only exists for some accounts.

### Token refresh task

The current five-minute single-account loop becomes one shared timer that fans out through `AccountManager.refreshAllIfNeeded()`.

## Suggested PR Order

1. Add `Account`, extend `TokenStore` additively, and cover it with tests.
2. Add migration on launch. Let `Session` and `UserSettings` carry `accounts` and `activeAccountID`, while the rest of the app still reads through the active account. This should be a no-visible-change release.
3. Add `AccountManager` and per-account `GitHubClient`, then refactor `AppState` refresh to fan out while keeping the UI effectively single-account.
4. Add the user-visible multi-account UI: account list, add account, remove account, and menu grouping.
5. Add cache partitioning, CLI `--account`, and notification/reference-monitor `accountID` propagation.

This sequence keeps each PR reviewable, preserves the existing single-account contract through the transition, and reduces the risk of mixing storage migration, UI, and cache invalidation in one large change.
