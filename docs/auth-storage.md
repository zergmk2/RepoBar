# Auth Storage

RepoBar has two token storage modes:

- **Keychain**: production default. OAuth tokens, client credentials, and PATs use the macOS Keychain.
- **File**: debug/autonomy mode. Tokens are stored as JSON files under `~/Library/Application Support/RepoBar/DebugAuth`.

`TokenStore.shared` chooses the backend in this order:

1. `REPOBAR_TOKEN_STORE` environment variable.
2. `RepoBarTokenStore` in the app bundle `Info.plist`.
3. Debug-build file storage fallback.
4. Release-build Keychain fallback.

Accepted file values are `file` and `disk`. Set `REPOBAR_TOKEN_STORE=keychain` to force Keychain in debug builds.

## Debug App Builds

`Scripts/package_app.sh debug` writes this into the generated app bundle:

```xml
<key>RepoBarTokenStore</key><string>file</string>
```

That means `pnpm start` and `pnpm restart` use file-backed auth and must not trigger macOS Keychain prompts during autonomous development. The debug app still signs normally, but it also strips `keychain-access-groups` when no provisioning profile is configured.

SwiftPM debug CLI/test binaries do not have the app bundle `Info.plist`, so debug builds also default to file-backed storage in code. Local `swift test`, `pnpm test`, `.build/debug/repobarcli`, and the packaged debug app therefore share the same non-Keychain backend unless explicitly overridden.

To force the same behavior for an installed release CLI/debug process:

```sh
REPOBAR_TOKEN_STORE=file repobar status
```

To force Keychain while debugging:

```sh
REPOBAR_TOKEN_STORE=keychain pnpm start
REPOBAR_TOKEN_STORE=keychain .build/debug/repobarcli status
```

## Release Builds

Release builds do not write `RepoBarTokenStore=file`, so they use Keychain by default.

Developer ID builds currently strip `keychain-access-groups` unless `REPOBAR_SKIP_KEYCHAIN_GROUPS=0` is set for a properly provisioned build. Without a valid provisioning profile, shipping that entitlement causes AMFI launch failures on newer macOS versions.

## File Backend Notes

The file backend exists for local debug autonomy, not for shipped secrets. It stores the same data shape as Keychain:

- `default`: OAuth access/refresh tokens.
- `client`: OAuth client credentials.
- `pat`: Personal Access Token.

Files are written with `0600` permissions where supported. `TokenStore.clear()` removes the file-backed OAuth, client, and PAT entries for the configured service.

## Account-Scoped Keys (Phase 1)

In addition to the legacy fixed keys above, `TokenStore` accepts account-scoped APIs that key each item by `accountID`:

- `<accountID>:default` — OAuth access/refresh tokens for the account.
- `<accountID>:client` — OAuth client credentials for the account.
- `<accountID>:pat` — Personal Access Token for the account.

Public APIs:

- `save(tokens:accountID:)`, `loadTokens(accountID:)`
- `save(clientCredentials:accountID:)`, `loadClientCredentials(accountID:)`
- `savePAT(_:accountID:)`, `loadPAT(accountID:)`
- `clear(accountID:)` removes all three kinds for one account.
- `allAccountIDs()` returns the union of account IDs found in file storage and (best effort) Keychain.

Storage representation:

- **Keychain**: `kSecAttrAccount` is set to `"<accountID>:<kind>"`. `allAccountIDs()` enumerates entries for the configured service (across access groups) and parses out the account ID prefix, ignoring legacy fixed accounts.
- **File**: files are still named `<service>-<account>.json`. The colon separator is sanitized to a dash, so on disk you will see `…-<accountID>-default.json`, `…-<accountID>-client.json`, and `…-<accountID>-pat.json`. Because the on-disk name is sanitized (e.g., `#` → `-`), the filename is not a reliable source of the original account ID. To preserve the original string, file storage also maintains a small JSON index at `<service>-accounts-index.json` next to the token files. Each account-scoped `save…(accountID:)` call records the original `accountID` in this index, and `clear(accountID:)` removes it. `allAccountIDs()` returns the union of indexed IDs and any IDs scanned from filenames (the latter only as a fallback for entries that pre-date the index), sorted and deduplicated. Legacy non-account wrappers (`save(tokens:)`, `savePAT(_:)`, etc.) never write to the index.

The legacy `save(tokens:)`, `load()`, `save(clientCredentials:)`, `loadClientCredentials()`, `savePAT(_:)`, `loadPAT()`, `clear()`, and `clearPAT()` APIs are preserved as wrappers over the fixed `default` / `client` / `pat` keys for backwards compatibility during the multi-account transition.

## Multi-Account Wiring

Phase 2+ wires the account-scoped keys to the rest of the app:

- `AccountManager` (`Sources/RepoBar/Auth/AccountManager.swift`) owns one `GitHubClient` per `Account` and runs an `AccountScopedOAuthRefresher` that reads and writes tokens via `loadTokens(accountID:)` / `save(tokens:accountID:)`.
- On launch, `AppState.bootstrapAccounts()` calls `migrateLegacyAccountIfNeeded()` which probes `GET /user` with whichever credential currently lives under the legacy fixed keys, derives a stable `Account` (`<host>#<username>`), and copies the existing OAuth tokens / client credentials / PAT under the new account-scoped keys. The legacy entries are left in place so that downgrading to a previous build still finds them.
- After successful `repobar login` or `repobar import-gh-token`, both commands probe `GET /user`, derive an `Account`, persist tokens under `<accountID>:default` / `<accountID>:client` / `<accountID>:pat`, and append the account to `UserSettings.accounts`. The legacy fast-path entries are also written so that callers that still read `TokenStore.shared.load()` keep working.
- `HTTPResponseDiskCache.databaseURL(accountID:)` and `RepoBarPersistentCache.databaseURL(accountID:)` resolve to `~/Library/Application Support/RepoBar/Cache/<safe-account-id>.sqlite`, so each `GitHubClient` writes responses to its own SQLite database. Passing `accountID: nil` returns the legacy shared path.
